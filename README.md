# 🎧 Python Music Player App

A simple command-line **music playlist application** built with Python.  
It allows users to view playlists, play songs, and add new tracks to existing or new artists — all from the terminal.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎶 View all songs and artists in the playlist  
- ▶️ Select and “play” a song using the `1:1` format  
- ➕ Add new songs or create new artist playlists  
- 💡 Built with clean, well-documented Python code

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The program displays a list of available playlists and songs.
2. You choose a song to “play” using the format `1:1`.
